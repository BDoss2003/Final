We started with a basic command line application that functioned well but had no data presistency and no ability to interact with a database or create well structured program.  We transformwed this into a SOLID, APP architecture

Barky Refactor 1
For this refactor we added and learned about (DRF, ORM, and Repository Pattern): Assignment 5 
Our goal was to 
1. Replace the custom data handling (the DatabaseManager module) with the [Django O/RM].  the database we chose was sqlite
    1. Replace the existing DatabaseManager with the Django ORM.
    2. Replace the CLI web-based REST API using the Django REST Framework.
    3. SOLID
    4. Use [DRF's testing facilities]
2. Adopt the suggestions from Percival and Gregory regarding the Unit of Work and Respository Pattern and Django: [Appendix D: Repository and Unit of Work Patterns with Django]
